### Manipulating data with dplyr



* tidyverse
* individual functions that correspond with typical operations
* verbs
  * filter
  * arrange
  * select
  * summarize
  * groupby
  * mutate
* Uses Tibbles
  * modern take
  * Keep good aspects (different variable types)
  * drops bad aspects
    * no more "colname.1"
    * keeps input type when reading in



What is piping? Use to emphasize a sequence of actions

* %>%
* lets you pass an intermediate result onto the next function
  * takes output of one statement and makes input of another
* Avoid if intermeidate objects are meaningful or you want to manipulate more than one object at the same time



Piping format:

* Dataset %>% 1st function %>% 2nd function
